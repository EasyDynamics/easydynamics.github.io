## Joining the Easy Dynamics Organization

If you've signed in and you still don't see the repository, it may be a private repository 
within the organization. If you are a member of the Easy Dynamics organization, skip to
[Requesting access to private repositories as a member](#requesting-access-to-private-repositories-as-a-member).
If not, fill out the form at the link below. You will be asked for the following information:

| Full Name                     | The name of the person requesting access              |
| Email Address                 | The email address of the person requesting access     |
| GitHub Username (optional)    | The GitHub username if preferred over email address   |

**NOTE:** If you do not have a GitHub account linked to the email address provided. 
You will have to create a GitHub account and follow GitHub's process as described 
on [Signing up for a new GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account).

Generally, personal accounts are acceptable as long as they are linked to an organizational email address.

Once we have received the request, we will send an invitation to the email address listed 
in the request to join our GitHub organization as an outside collaborator. The email should look
something like the image below.

**NOTE:** The invitation will come from the email address **noreply@github.com**, so please make sure
to either mark the domain as safe or check your spam folder in case it accidentally got moved there.

Once you click the **Join @EasyDynamics** link in the email, you will be asked to either sign in with 
a GitHub account or create a new one. Please do so accordingly. If you need additional help with creating
a GitHub account, please refer to
[Signing up for a new GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account).

Once you have joined the organization (either temporarily or permanently) you should be able to access private repositories, or
request additional access to them as described below.

## Requesting access to private repositories as a member

If you are signed in as a member of the Easy Dynamics organization and still can't access a known repository, you will need to request access using the form linked below. The form will ask for the following information:

| Repository Link  | The link/URL to the repository                                        |
| Permission Level | The desired permission level                                          |

You may only specify one of the following permission levels:

- Admin

For more information about each of the permission levels see [Permission levels for repositories owned by an organization](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization#permission-levels-for-repositories-owned-by-an-organization).
